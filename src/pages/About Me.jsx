				I have a passion for all that is IT, but my main area of interest and
				expression has always been coding.
				<br />
				Be it a BASH script to map my keyboard’s extra key’s from F13 to F24, or
				bug fixing an old ASP application that a client bought in the ‘90s to
				make it work under
				<br />
				Windows 10, code is where I always felt more at ease.
